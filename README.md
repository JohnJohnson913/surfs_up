Challenge 9 Surfs Up Deliverable 3

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to collect and analyze weather data on Oahu to make sure that the surf and ice cream shop would have the appropriate weather in those two months to remain successful.   This analysis was completed to address 
concerns brought by our partner W.Avy that it the weather may not be appropriate for our store.  

## Results - The Findings

 - After analyzing the data, it appears we've found a good location for the shop.  The temperatures between the summer and winter month only vary slightly, between 3-4 degrees for each quartile.
