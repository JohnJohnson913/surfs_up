Challenge 9 Surfs Up Deliverable 3

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to collect and analyze weather data on Oahu to make sure that the surf and ice cream shop would have the appropriate weather in those two months to remain successful.   This analysis was completed to address 
concerns brought by our partner W.Avy that it the weather may not be appropriate for our store.  

## Results - The Findings

 - After analyzing the data, it appears we've found a good location for the shop.  The temperatures between the summer and winter month only vary slightly, between 3-4 degrees for each quartile.

 - Ideally the max temps stay reletively close with only a 2 degree difference.   Though the tempuratures may be slightly cooler in December, it's likely that when high temps occure in December individuals will likely rush out and want ice cream and surf board rentals more so than in the summer just to soak up the fewer days that are warm.

 - Lastly, we can confidently rely on this data as the volume of data reviewed is significant with 1700 and 1517 days reviewed over the past years.   Both have a std deviation of only 3.26 and 3.75 respectively, proving the findings of this analysis valid.

## Additional Research Ideas

As a result, the temps in the two months don't vary enought to have a significant impact on sales.  Though the temperature data is important, there are a few items that may be worth exploring if W. Avy requires a few more data points to solidify the backing.  I may recommend the following:

 - Precipitation data:  It may be important to analyze if there is a more rain in certain times than others.   Additionally, if the rain volumes are different than other islands within the chain of Hawaii.
 - Cloudiness data:  It may impact the sale of ice cream more than surfing, but it may still be important.
